<p>The council is legally required to maintain a register of previously developed sites within the borough&nbsp;which are available and potentially suitable for housing. This does not include&nbsp;land or buildings in agricultural use or residential gardens. All sites must meet the definition of ‘previously developed land’ as set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/annex-2-glossary" target="_blank">National Planning Policy Framework</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Kingston's brownfield register</h3>

<p>The first edition of <a href="https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/793/kingston_brownfield_register_-_december_2017">Kingston's public register</a> was published on 21 December 2017. You can view individual site plans on the <a href="https://maps.london.gov.uk/brownfield-site-register/">Greater London Authority's website</a>. The register will be reviewed at least once a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The register is kept in two parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Part 1 comprises of all brownfield sites in the borough, which:
	<ul>
		<li>are at least 0.25 hectares or capable of supporting at least 5 dwellings</li>
		<li>meet the Government's criteria of being suitable, available and achievable for residential development.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Part 2 comprises of housing-led sites which the council consider suitable to be granted ‘permission in principle’. At this stage no sites have been identified for inclusion in part 2 of the register.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Government guidance and legislation</h3>

<p>The government has published guidance on brownfield land registers and permission in principle:&nbsp;</p>
